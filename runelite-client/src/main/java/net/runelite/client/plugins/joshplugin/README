# TODO

- [done] Make MTCS support both in game pathing and mocked pathing
- Setup separate build project for plugin
- [done] Add support for importing test simulation from file/compressed format
- Add sized mobs to monte carlo simulation
- Add support for multiple actions within same tick in MCTS
- Add support for clicking tiles many units away rather than just moving one tile at a time
- Simulate fighting mechanics (mage, ranged, melee, prayer, eating/potting)
- Better rewarding (minimizing HP loss? minimizing resources used?)
- Lastly, add ability to execute an action generated by MCTS in game
